# Introduction

U-Net Studio is a segmentation tool for human and animal brain images. It devises a unique data augmentation method that allows for using only one template image to train a 3D U-Net from scratch. U-Net Studio provides segmentation models for mice, rats, marmosets, rhesus monkeys, and humans, accomplishing tasks such as skull-stripping, and segmentation of white matter, gray matter, cerebellum cortex, and basal ganglia. 

These models are easily adaptable and retrainable for various imaging modalities, streamlining the segmentation process and reducing the need for manual annotation.
